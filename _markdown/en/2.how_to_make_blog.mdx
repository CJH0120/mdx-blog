_In this post, we will examine the libraries used in the blog and the method for importing MDX files._

#### Identifying My Needs

1. Zero operating costs
2. Easy design customization
3. SEO optimization
4. Fast page loading
5. No database usage

**Now, let's take a closer look**

<br />

## Zero Operating Costs

This can be easily addressed using Vercel.

### What is Vercel?

Vercel is a hosting platform that supports serverless environments. Routes and server-side code are deployed as Serverless Functions, allowing for free hosting. However, be aware that upgrading to a paid version may be more expensive than AWS.

## Easy Design Customization

Design is undoubtedly one of the most important aspects. While each service requires its own design, Iâ€™m not particularly skilled in design, so I used the [Toss Blog](https://toss.tech) as a reference. Future features will be planned separately, but for now, I will implement the design in the desired direction and add more as needed.

## SEO Optimization and Fast Page Loading

For a React-based framework that meets these two criteria, **Gatsby.js** and **Next.js** are options. I chose Next.js.

#### Reasons for Choice

1. It is a framework currently used in the industry.
2. There is a need to further learn about AppRouter functions.

## No Database Usage

I chose a file-based content management approach using MDX. This avoids the complexities of a database and makes content management more convenient from both development and maintenance perspectives.

## What Libraries Were Used?

**package.json**

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@next/third-parties": "^14.2.7",
    "@vercel/analytics": "^1.3.1",
    "next": "14.2.5",
    "prismjs": "^1.29.0",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  },

"devDependencies": {
    "@mdx-js/loader": "^3.0.1",
    "@mdx-js/react": "^3.0.1",
    "@next/mdx": "^14.2.7",
    "@types/mdx": "^2.0.13",
    "@types/node": "^20.16.2",
    "@types/prismjs": "^1.26.4",
    "@types/react": "^18.3.4",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.0",
    "eslint": "^8.57.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.2.5",
    "gray-matter": "^4.0.3",
    "image-size": "^1.1.1",
    "next-mdx-remote": "^5.0.0",
    "sass": "^1.77.8",
    "sharp": "^0.33.5",
    "typescript": "^5.5.4"
}
```

### prismjs

A library that provides syntax highlighting for code in MDX.

### @mdx

A library that helps render MDX files in React applications, playing a crucial role in this blog.

### next-mdx-remote

A library that enables dynamic use of MDX libraries.

### gray-matter

A library used to extract metadata and content from Markdown files, including MDX files.

**How to Use gray-matter**

```ts
import matter from 'gray-matter';

/* 
MDX

hi 


//matter types

const content: string;

const data: {
    [key: string]: any;
}
*/

const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);
```

#### gray-matter result

```ts
console.log(data)
=>{
 title: 'Learn How the Blog Works - MDX',
description: 'I will explain how my blog is organized and how it works.',
date: '2024.8.27',
thumbnail: 'image/thumbnail/th_2.webp',
path: 'next mdx',
series: 'Blog Creation Process'
}

console.log(content)
=>
Hi
```

`data` is returned as an object, while `content` is returned as a string.

### image-size

A library that provides the dimensions of local images, used for image optimization.

## sass

Sass is a **CSS preprocessor** that extends CSS functionality and makes writing and maintaining CSS easier. It is one of my favorite libraries.

## What Functions Were Used

You can find the detailed code in [useReadMdx.tsx](https://github.com/CJH0120/mdx-blog/blob/main/hooks/useReadMdx.ts).

```ts
export const useReadMdx = async (pathUrl?: string): Promise<MDX.Metadata[] | MDX.DetailProps> => {
  const markdownDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), '_markdown');
  const filenames = await fs.readdir(markdownDirectory);

  let current_content = undefined;
  let current_tag: string[] = [];
  let current_series: string | undefined = undefined;

  const markdownMetaData: MDX.Metadata[] = await Promise.all(
    filenames.map(async (filename) => {
      const filePath = path.join(markdownDirectory, filename);
      const meta = await parseMarkdownFile(filePath);
      if (!!pathUrl && normalizePath(pathUrl) === meta.path) {
        const fileContents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
        const { content, data } = matter(fileContents);
        current_content = content;
        current_tag = data.tags;
        current_series = data.series;
      }
      return { ...meta };
    })
  ).then((data) => data.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime()));

  if (pathUrl && typeof current_content === 'string') {
    const currentMetaIdx = markdownMetaData.findIndex((data) => data.path === normalizePath(pathUrl)) as number;

    let tagsArray = [];
    for (const tag of current_tag) {
      const resultSearchData = markdownMetaData.filter((data) => data.path !== normalizePath(pathUrl) && data.tags.includes(tag));
      resultSearchData.length && tagsArray.push({ [tag]: resultSearchData });
    }

    return {
      content: current_content,
      meta: markdownMetaData[currentMetaIdx],
      series: !!current_series ? markdownMetaData.filter((data) => data.series === (current_series as string)).reverse() : null,
      tags: !!current_tag.length ? tagsArray : null,
    };
  } else {
    return markdownMetaData;
  }
};
```

### Code Explanation

Overall, the logic changes depending on the presence of `pathUrl`.

#### Common

After reading all files in the `_markdown` folder, the files are sorted by metadata in descending order.

#### When `pathUrl` Exists

Since the detailed page of a post is being viewed, it returns metadata for the given `path`, posts with the same tags, series posts, and the content of the specific post.

#### When `pathUrl` Does Not Exist

The absence of `pathUrl` signifies the main screen, so only the overall metadata is returned.

### In Closing

In this post, we explored the libraries used and how to load MDX files. In the next post, we will look into how to utilize functions in `Next.js`.
