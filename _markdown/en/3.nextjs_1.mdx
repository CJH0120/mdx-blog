# What is Most Important?

<br />

> What do you feel is the most important aspect when creating a website?

**I always prioritize the initial page loading speed.**

- **Google** has studied the impact of web page loading times on user behavior. According to Google's report, for every additional second of page loading time, the user bounce rate increases by 2%.
- **Amazon** has also researched the impact of page loading times on sales. Their study found that for every additional second of page loading time, sales decreased by 1%.

According to announcements from big tech companies, no matter how well you design the UI/UX for clients, if the initial speed slows down to 10, 20, or 30 seconds, who will use it? From the early stages of development, I emphasized the performance of Lighthouse.

> How can we achieve fast rendering?

Currently, there are various rendering methods such as SSR, SSG, and ISR. Understanding what these rendering techniques are is crucial, so let me briefly explain each concept.

### SSR (Server Side Rendering)

- Provides HTML generated in real-time by the server every time a client requests a page.

### SSG (Static Site Generation)

- Pre-generates HTML files at build time, providing static files when requested by the server.

### ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

- Allows updating of HTML based on specific conditions or intervals while still pre-generating static pages.

> Which rendering method should we choose?

#### Identifying My Needs

1. Zero operating costs
2. Easy design customization
3. SEO optimization
4. Fast page loading
5. No database usage

Given these criteria, SSR is excluded since we are not using a database. Since there is no need for periodic updates to static files, SSG seems to be the most suitable option.

So, how can we generate SSG with Next.js App Router?

According to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) official documentation,
there is a function called `generateStaticParams` which allows **static path generation at build time**.

Let‚Äôs apply this feature to the blog.

**Folder Structure for Detailed Posts**

````mdx
üì¶app
‚î£ üìÇarticle
‚îÉ ‚îó üìÇ[slug]
‚îÉ ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìúarticle.module.scss
‚îÉ ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìúlayout.tsx
‚îÉ ‚îÉ ‚îó üìúpage.tsx

According to the official documentation, you can execute the function inside `page.tsx`, or if using in a top-down format, you can use it inside `layout.tsx`.

#### Using generateStaticParams

```ts
import { useReadMdxFile as getFiles, useReadMdx as getDetail } from '@/hooks/useReadMdx';

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = ((await getDetail()) as MDX.Metadata[]) ?? [];
  return posts?.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.path,
  }));
}
```
````

#### After Build

```mdx
‚óè /article/[slug] 11.4 kB 110 kB

‚óã (Static) prerendered as static content
‚óè (SSG) prerendered as static HTML (uses getStaticProps)
```

Next.js automatically generates `SSG`.

#### What Happens if generateStaticParams is Absent?

```mdx
‚îú ∆í /article/[slug] 11.4 kB 110 kB

∆í (Dynamic) server-rendered on demand
```

In this case, it will be generated using `SSR`.

**Since we‚Äôve come this far, let‚Äôs briefly look at how to generate ISR.**

```ts
export const revalidate = 60;
```

```mdx
Adding `revalidate` at the top of `generateStaticParams` converts it to ISR. The above code means that `SSG` will be regenerated every 60 seconds.

Another method involves using the `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` functions. For more details, check out the [Next.js Functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#functions) documentation.

### In Closing

Today, we briefly explored the rendering techniques and methods provided by the Next.js App Router. In the next post, we will look into SEO-related functions in Next.js.
